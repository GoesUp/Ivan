# Ivan
It's just like Fran, but fancier. And made by me.

## Purpose
I am a frequent user of Fran, but I was surprised to discover that they have no official app.
So I decided to make my own.

## How does Ivan work?
This is the entire magic:
1. The user input the search query.
2. Ivan generates a search URL for Fran.
3. Ivan scrapes the search result from Fran.
4. Ivan parses the received results and presents them to the user in a minimalistic, yet elegant manner.
5. The user, after looking at the definition of their favourite word, experiences a brief moment of happiness.
